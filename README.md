# Slovak Virtual Keyboard

This application is a simple Slovak virtual keyboard for Windows based PCs. You can use your computer keyboard or mouse to type Slovak letters with this keyboard. Also, this application has an autocomplete function.

To type diacritical marks, use the held down Alt key. To use autocomplete, press the TAB key or click on the word in the upper right part of the application.

## Requirements

 - A desktop platform that can compile .NET 4.7.2. I recommend using Visual Studio Community Edition (Windows), Visual Studio for Mac (macOS) or MonoDevelop (Linux), all of which are free.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository  (`https://github.com/komarowski/Slovak-Keyboard.git`).
- Build project in your IDE of choice.
- To work autocomplete drag the file `sk.txt` into the same folder with the executable file.

## Contributing

Contributions will not be accepted for the project at this time.

## Acknowledgments

A list of Slovak words sorted by frequency was taken from this [site](http://p.brm.sk/sk_wordlist/).
